# Hi, I’m Dikshya

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a Computer Science student at Berea College, and I love building things—tools, websites, simulations, whatever lets me merge creativity with technical problem-solving. I’m driven by curiosity, and I tend to take on projects that teach me something new or challenge me to think differently.

Right now, I’m especially interested in software engineering, front-end development, data structures, and any tech that blends design with functionality. I’m also exploring language learning tools, game theory, and accessible web design.

This page highlights my work, experience, and what I’ve been learning along the way.
