# 👋 Hey, I'm Dia Paudel — Developer by day, Worldbuilder by night.

> *"I build apps, break down algorithms, and dream up dystopias."*

## 📍 About Me

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering Technologies student at Berea College (`Class of 2028`) with a passion for full-stack development, language accessibility, and storytelling.

Whether I’m helping build web tools for energy equity, simulating game theory on a billion board states, or writing a fantasy novel about a princess hiding a deadly secret in a crumbling caste system—I’m always chasing complexity with clarity.
